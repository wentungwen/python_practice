 
Other factors that can influence framing effects include personal values and beliefs, social norms, and the context in which the information is presented. For example, a message about the importance of wearing a mask may be more effective if it is framed in terms of personal values (e.g., “Protect yourself and your loved ones”) rather than in terms of potential losses (e.g., “If you do not wear a mask, lives may be lost”).  17
Other factors such as the availability heuristic (e.g., the tendency to overestimate the likelihood of an event because it is more easily recalled) and the representativeness heuristic (e.g., judging the likelihood of an event based on how similar it is to a prototype) can also influence risk perceptions and decision-making.  17
Prospect theory suggests that people are more likely to take risks when faced with potential losses than when faced with potential gains. This is because people are risk averse when it comes to gains and risk seeking when it comes to losses. This is demonstrated in the two gambles presented above; most people would choose Gamble 1 because it has a guaranteed gain, even though it has a lower expected value (EV) than Gamble 2.
